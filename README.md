Urban Street Network Morphology Subtypes (USNMS) Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains urban street network morphology data for the analysis of urban street network structures. It includes samples from major U.S. cities, categorized into six distinct street network morphology types. The dataset has been constructed to support urban planning and network analysis research.

Dataset Construction
The dataset was built using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data from 12 major cities in the United States, extracted via OSMnx. The OSM data were divided into grid patches measuring 1 km Ã— 1 km.

The dataset includes six categories of urban street network morphology:

Regular Grid

Irregular Grid

Broken Grid

Warped Parallel

Loops & Lollipops

Sparse

These categories were selected based on previous studies and visual observation of the street networks in the study areas.

Sample Labelling
The dataset was labeled manually by a team of urban planning experts, ensuring accurate classification based on predefined categories. The labeling process involved expert judgment, visual inspection, and a majority vote when needed.

Dataset Partitioning
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets for 10-fold cross-validation, with a 6:2:2 ratio for sample distribution.
